# payspace-test
### Running / Serving the website locally
Because the Javascript is using modules 'export' and 'import', we need to serve the app locally to prevent CORS erros.

1. `cd payspace-test` then run `http-server` to locally serve the application using Node.

    If you dont have http server installed, `npm install --global http-server`
2. Click the link created by above step and open the application on your browser.
